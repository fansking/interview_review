### 自我介绍

  我叫吕若凡，2021年在武汉大学毕业，在毕业之前先后在腾讯和阿里实习，最终我的第一份正式工作选择了阿里淘宝开放平台部门。我在这里主要负责隐私号项目-订单保护项目的子项目，为了保护消费者的隐私信息，淘宝在订单履约的全链路中将消费者的手机号替换为一个虚拟号(11主机号+4位分机号)，这听上去好像是一个很简单的操作，但实现起来却没那么容易，这个项目不仅有技术挑战:双十一大促的高并发问题、还有复杂的业务问题，多地址多手机号、履约生态庞大等。
  凭借这个项目我们拿了很多奖项，在阿里的正式工作一年我得到了快速的成长，我负责并设计了许多技术方案，例如百亿级数据库的在线扩容、历史数据库实现和大促高峰及热点流量的解决方案等。但是今天我并不满足于做这些业务，业务上并没有所谓的技术难题，在解决业务问题后回头看，我下一年很难再有技术上的飞速成长，只有项目管理的能力和业务沉淀。而我则希望做一些更有技术深度的项目或者在更大的平台找到更多学习资料，这也是我参加XX面试的原因，同时公司优秀的包容文化，轻松的工作氛围，也让我倾倒。



  My name is Lv Ruofan who graduated from Wuhan University in 2021. Before graduating, I have interned in Tencent and Alibaba. At last, I choose the Alibaba Taobao Open Platform as first official job. I'm mainly responsible for virtual number project, which is a sub-project of order-privacy-info-protect porject.In order to protect the privacy information of consumers, Taobao replaces the consumer's mobile phone number with a virtual number which consist of 11 main number and 4 extend number in the whole link of order work.  It sounds like a very simple operation, but it is not so easy to implement. This project not only has technical challenges: the high concurrency problem of the Singles Day, but also complex business problems, Multiple addresses and Multiple phone, contract logistics companies, etc.
  With this project, we win many awards and I have grown rapidly in one year of formal work in Alibaba. I own and designed many technical solutions, such as online expansion of 10 billion level database, implementation of historical database and solutions to high concurrency and hot request flow. But today I am not satisfied with doing these businesses. There are no so-called technical problems in the business. Looking back after solving the business problems, it is difficult for me to have rapid technological growth next year. Only the ability of project management and business understanding. I hope to do some more technical projects or find more learning materials on a larger platform, which is why I joined XX interview. At the same time, the excellent inclusive culture and relaxed working atmosphere of the company also fascinated me.
